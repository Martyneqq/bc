# Web Application for Registering Finances of Small Businesses
This bachelor project focuses on creating an application designed to help small businesses in the Czech Republic manage their tax records. The existing market for accounting applications in the country is diverse but often lacks features for tax record keeping, especially for small businesses. The goal is to develop a user-friendly, accessible, and free application that is compatible with various operating systems and devices. The application is published on the Internet and incorporates responsiveness for mobile devices. The use of open-source libraries, including Bootstrap for UI elements and Plotly for graph generation, ensures a visually appealing and organized interface.
